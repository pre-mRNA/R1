# R1
Classification of long-read RNA splicing and transcriptional status from long reads

# Overview
ROGUE1 classifies the transcriptional and splicing status of long RNA reads, generated by nanopore or pacbio RNA/cDNA sequencing.

# Dependencies

### TODO: update dependencies 
```
Python 3.8 or higher
Pandas
Pysam
NumPy
BEDTools
Samtools
```

# Input Data:

### TODO: update input data requirements
BAM File: Prepare a BAM file containing RNA sequencing reads.
GTF File: A GTF file containing gene annotations.

# Usage: 

### TODO: update usage
Run the main script run_bedtools.py with the necessary arguments:

```
python r1.py --bam_file path/to/bamfile.bam --gtf_file path/to/annotations.gtf --output_dir path/to/output_table.txt
```

# Output:

### TODO: update outputs 

The program will output several BED files representing the intersections of reads with genomic features such as exons, genes, and regions downstream of genes (DOG).
Additional outputs include summarized classifications of reads based on their biotypes and structural annotations.

Post-Processing:
Use parse_output.py to further analyze and visualize the data:

# Notes
- Ensure that the output directory has adequate space as genomic data can be quite large.
- The program is optimized for performance on systems with multiple CPUs and substantial RAM. Adjust the number of threads and buffer sizes in the scripts according to your system's capabilities.
